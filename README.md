In our rapidly changing digital age, the way we absorb information is shifting dramatically. Traditional learning methods often can't keep pace with the needs of today's learners, who crave quick, digestible content.Many young people find themselves spending hours on social media, often interacting with content that offers little to no educational value.

I personally wanted to address this challenge, and so I created aIQ (AI + IQ) [Pronounced in the same manner as IQ] ‚Äîa heartfelt, open-source and innovative ed-tech social media platform. aIQ harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to offer engaging, bite-sized learning experiences that are as enjoyable as they are educational. With its AI-generated snippets structured in the 5W1H framework, aIQ makes learning not just accessible, but a delightful journey of discovery.

### ‚ùì What is the problem that aIQ is trying to address?

- **Social Media Addiction:** Many young people are spending significant amounts of time on social media platforms, often engaging with content that lacks educational value.

- **Lack of Valuable Information:** The prevalent content on social media is often misleading or highly superficial, not contributing to personal growth or knowledge acquisition.

- **Reduced Critical Thinking:** Constant exposure to non-educational content can lead to a decline in critical thinking and analytical skills.

- **Knowledge Gap:** There's a growing gap in accessible, quality educational content that is both engaging and informative on social media platforms.

<br>

### üöÄ How aIQ can be the solution

- **Educational Social Media:** aIQ transforms the social media experience by offering a platform where users can engage with AI-powered educational snippets.

- **Valuable Knowledge:** Provides content structured in the 5W1H format (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How), making it easy to understand and retain valuable information.

- **Engaging and Informative:** Combines the engaging aspects of social media with informative content, encouraging users to learn while they scroll.

- **Enhanced Critical Thinking:** By exposing users to structured and thoughtful content, aIQ fosters improved critical thinking and knowledge acquisition among its audience.

<br>

### üí° Why was I motivated to create aIQ

I was inspired to create aIQ because I saw how countless young people, including those close to me and even myself at times, were spending hours on social media without gaining anything meaningful. It saddened me to see potential being wasted on content that neither educates nor enriches lives. I wanted to create a space where people could turn their screen time into a valuable learning experience, where knowledge and growth were just a scroll away. aIQ is my way of offering a meaningful alternative‚Äîa place where engaging, bite-sized educational content can empower users to expand their minds and discover new passions. This platform is my hope for a brighter, more informed future for all who use it.

_NOTE - Some tables like rewards are not used for now but created for upcoming features._

The SQL code to create all these tables and relations in Xata are available here. Note that id (Primary key), created_at, updated_at (metadata fields) are not explicitly created for the tables as Xata creates them by default and so I took advantage of it üòÅ

<br>

### üëåüèª Best practices

- Usage of TypeScript makes the code robust and almost free of errors.

- aIQ is SEO-friendly and performs amazingly well in Lighthouse stats.

- Linter was utilized to ensure the absence of any errors in the codebase.

- Vercel speed insights and analytics packages have been added to track site performance and analytics.

- The codebase has been equipped with a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup, facilitated by Vercel. The codebase contains two branches - one for production and one for development, and both branches have been set with branch protection rules to minimize the occurrence of undesired errors.

### aIQ ‚ù§Ô∏è open source

aIQ is dedicated to the principles of openness and collaboration, embracing an open-source ethos to foster innovation and community involvement. The platform is not only free and accessible but also transparent, with all LLM prompts and source code available on GitHub. This commitment ensures that anyone can contribute, adapt, and build upon my work. By remaining open source forever, aIQ empowers a global community to continuously enhance and expand the platform, driving progress and keeping the pursuit of knowledge inclusive and dynamic.

### Conclusion

Creating aIQ has been a deeply personal journey for me, driven by a desire to make learning both accessible and meaningful. I wanted to build something that could transform the way we engage with information, turning hours spent on social media into opportunities for growth and discovery. 

By making aIQ open source and sharing the source code on GitHub, I hope to invite others into this vision‚Äîempowering anyone to contribute, adapt, and enhance aIQ. This commitment to openness is my way of ensuring that aIQ remains a collaborative, ever-evolving platform. As I watch this project grow and flourish, I am filled with hope and gratitude, knowing that together we can create a world where knowledge is not just a pursuit, but a shared journey.
